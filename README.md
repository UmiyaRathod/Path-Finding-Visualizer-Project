# Path-Finding-Visualizer-Project

I created this project because I was fascinated by DSA and the algorithms. Visualizing makes us learn more effictively.

#Algorithms used
Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted)
A Search* (weighted)
Greedy Best-first Search (weighted)
Swarm Algorithm (weighted)
Convergent Swarm Algorithm (weighted)
Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm (weighted)
Breath-first Search (unweighted)
Depth-first Search (unweighted)
